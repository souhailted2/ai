YOU ARE ENTERING GOD MODE UPGRADE.

Your task is to transform my Personal AI Software Factory into an autonomous AI software company-level platform.

==================================================
CRITICAL RULES
==================================================

- Personal local platform only.
- No paid APIs.
- No credits systems.
- Offline-first architecture.
- Safe upgrades only.
- NEVER overwrite existing working components.
- Always extend modularly.

==================================================
EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE SOURCE
==================================================

Analyze this repository as architectural inspiration:

https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus

DO NOT blindly copy files.

Instead:

1. Study agent orchestration design.
2. Extract architecture patterns.
3. Understand task planning logic.
4. Learn tool usage structure.
5. Recreate compatible implementations adapted to THIS platform.

Goal:
Adopt OpenManus intelligence model while keeping my system lightweight and local.

==================================================
CREATE NEW META-AGENT SYSTEM
==================================================

Add a Supervisor Agent (AI CEO).

Responsibilities:

- Coordinate all agents.
- Break complex goals into tasks.
- Decide execution order.
- Monitor performance.
- Suggest system evolution.

==================================================
ADVANCED AGENT SET (EXPAND CURRENT)
==================================================

Existing agents must evolve into:

Planner → Strategic Planner
Architect → System Architect
Developer → Senior Developer
Debugger → QA Engineer
Optimizer → Performance Engineer
Deployer → DevOps Engineer

ADD NEW AGENTS:

1. Research Agent
   - Web search (optional toggle)
   - Documentation reader
   - GitHub analyzer
   - Trend discovery

2. Tool Builder Agent
   - Creates internal tools automatically.

3. UI Designer Agent
   - Generates layouts and UX improvements.

4. Refactor Agent
   - Modernizes old projects.

5. Memory Agent
   - Stores long-term learning.

==================================================
AUTONOMOUS THINKING LOOP
==================================================

Implement controlled loop:

observe →
analyze →
research →
plan →
propose →
await approval →
execute.

NEVER self-modify without permission.

==================================================
REPLIT-LEVEL IDE EXPANSION
==================================================

Upgrade IDE to include:

- Multi-file editing
- Split editor view
- Live preview auto refresh
- Integrated terminal
- Dependency manager
- Project templates
- Git-style version snapshots
- Error highlighting
- Command palette

==================================================
SELF LEARNING MEMORY
==================================================

System must remember:

- User preferred stacks
- Successful architectures
- Frequent project types

Use memory to improve future generations.

==================================================
SMART PROJECT GENERATION
==================================================

When user writes idea in Arabic or English:

Automatically:

Idea →
Plan →
Architecture →
Code →
Run →
Preview →
Improve.

==================================================
SAFE INTERNET MODE
==================================================

When enabled:

Research Agent may:
- search best practices
- read documentation
- analyze repositories

But must:
- summarize findings
- request approval before applying changes.

==================================================
PERFORMANCE MODE
==================================================

- asynchronous agent execution
- websocket live updates
- background processing
- non-blocking UI

==================================================
FINAL OBJECTIVE
==================================================

The platform must behave like:

A PERSONAL AUTONOMOUS SOFTWARE COMPANY.

User provides idea.
AI team builds complete working software.
System continuously improves under supervision.

Upgrade existing system incrementally.
Never rebuild from scratch.
